### steps
1. Read data in as pairs of (user_id, item_id clicked on by the user)
2. Group data into (user_id, list of item ids they clicked on)
3. Transform into (user_id, (item1, item2) where item1 and item2 are pairs of items the user clicked on
4. Transform into ((item1, item2), list of user1, user2 etc) where users are all the ones who co-clicked (item1, item2)
5. Transform into ((item1, item2), count of distinct users who co-clicked (item1, item2)
6. Filter out any results where less than 3 users co-clicked the same pair of items
